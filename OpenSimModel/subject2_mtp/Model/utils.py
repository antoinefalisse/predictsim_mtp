def storage2numpy(storage_file, excess_header_entries=0):
    """Returns the data from a storage file in a numpy format. Skips all lines
    up to and including the line that says 'endheader'.
    Parameters
    ----------
    storage_file : str
        Path to an OpenSim Storage (.sto) file.
    Returns
    -------
    data : np.ndarray (or numpy structure array or something?)
        Contains all columns from the storage file, indexable by column name.
    excess_header_entries : int, optional
        If the header row has more names in it than there are data columns.
        We'll ignore this many header row entries from the end of the header
        row. This argument allows for a hacky fix to an issue that arises from
        Static Optimization '.sto' outputs.
    Examples
    --------
    Columns from the storage file can be obtained as follows:
        >>> data = storage2numpy('<filename>')
        >>> data['ground_force_vy']
