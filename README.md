# 3D Predictive Simulations of Walking

This repository contains code and data to generate predictive simulations of human walking as described in "Modeling toes contributes to realistic stance knee mechanics in three-dimensional predictive simulations of walking". The paper has been submitted for publication. You can find the pre-print [here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.08.13.456292v1).

The main functions are: `predictsim_mtp.py` and `predictsim_no_mtp.py`. The first one is for simulations with models with toe joints, whereas the second one is for simulations with models without toe joints. The easiest is to start exploring the code from those functions. The code is relatively similar to the MATLAB one posted [here](https://github.com/antoinefalisse/3dpredictsim)

A lot of cleaning is still required to make this code user-friendly. I will work on that in the coming weeks. Please post an issue on GitHub if you would like to use this code already and need help.
